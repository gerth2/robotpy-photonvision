# robotpy-photonvision
This is a python wrapper around the Photonvision Photonlib library. The RobotPy project is not associated with or endorsed by Photonvision.

I had to install numpy to make pyi work: `python -m pip --disable-pip-version-check install 'numpy<2'`. Robotpy says this is broken in Raspbian CI
